# Task: Prepare Repository for GitHub Publication

## Context
We are preparing to publish the `orion` repository on GitHub. The goal is to ensure all documentation, workflows, and standards are polished and explicitly state the "AI Generated" nature of the project.

## Scope
1.  **README.md Updates**:
    *   Add a prominent "100% AI Generated" badge at the top.
    *   Add `docs/orion.png` to the right of the header section.
    *   Update "Contributing" section to reflect the AI-first workflow.
2.  **CONTRIBUTING.md & Process Updates**:
    *   Codify the "Code-Focused AI Policy": All source code must be generated via prompts.
    *   Define the workflow: Issue -> Task File (`.github/tasks/<ISSUE_NUMBER>_<snake_case_title>.md`) -> AI Execution.
3.  **GitHub Templates**:
    *   Create Issue Templates (`bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`).
    *   Create Pull Request Template with AI certification checkbox.
4.  **Consistency Check**:
    *   Review all markdown files for alignment.

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. README.md Layout
- Add this badge at the top (alongside existing badges): 
  `[![AI Generated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-100%25_AI_Generated-blueviolet)](CONTRIBUTING.md)`
- Embed `docs/orion.png` using HTML for right alignment in the first section (adjust width as needed, e.g., 150-200px):
  ```html
  <img src="docs/orion.png" align="right" width="180" alt="ORION Logo">
  ```
- **Action**: Ask the user for feedback on the visual layout after applying.

### 2. Contributing Policy (README & CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Policy**: "Source code changes must be generated by AI using a task prompt. Manual edits are allowed for documentation, configuration, and small fixes."
- **Workflow**:
  1.  Create an Issue.
  2.  Create a task file: `.github/tasks/<ISSUE_NUMBER>_<snake_case_title>.md`.
  3.  Use the appropriate template from `.github/prompts/` (if applicable).
  4.  Execute the task with an AI agent.
  5.  Follow the "Task Retrospective Process" defined in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### 3. GitHub Templates
- Create directory `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` if it doesn't exist.
- Create `bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md` with standard fields (Description, Reproduction, Expected Behavior).
- Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- **Crucial**: The PR template must include:
  - `[ ] I certify that the source code in this PR was generated by AI.`
  - `[ ] Link to task file: .github/tasks/NUMBER_title.md`

### 4. Consistency Review
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Ensure they don't contradict the new AI policy.
- Scan ALL markdown files in the repo for inconsistencies or omissions regarding the new workflow.
- **Action**: List any inconsistencies found in the **Retrospective** section below.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] README has badge and logo.
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md details the AI-first workflow.
- [ ] Issue and PR templates exist.
- [ ] All markdown files reviewed and inconsistencies logged.

## Retrospective
- **Inconsistencies Found**:
    - `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` needed updates to explicitly state the AI-first policy.
    - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` was updated to reinforce the "100% AI Generated" rule.
- **Actions Taken**:
    - Added badges and logo to `README.md`.
    - Defined the AI workflow in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    - Created Issue and PR templates.
    - Verified consistency across key documentation files.
