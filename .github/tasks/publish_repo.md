# Task: Prepare Repository for GitHub Publication

## Context
We are preparing to publish the `orion` repository on GitHub. The goal is to ensure all documentation, workflows, and standards are polished and explicitly state the "AI Generated" nature of the project.

## Scope
1.  **README.md Updates**:
    *   Add a prominent "100% AI Generated" badge at the top.
    *   Add `docs/orion.png` to the right of the header section.
    *   Update "Contributing" section to reflect the AI-first workflow.
2.  **CONTRIBUTING.md & Process Updates**:
    *   Codify the "Code-Focused AI Policy": All source code must be generated via prompts.
    *   Define the workflow: Issue -> Task File (`.github/tasks/<ISSUE_NUMBER>_<snake_case_title>.md`) -> AI Execution.
3.  **GitHub Templates**:
    *   Create Issue Templates (`bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`).
    *   Create Pull Request Template with AI certification checkbox.
4.  **Consistency Check**:
    *   Review ALL markdown files COMPLETELY for alignment.

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. README.md Layout
- Add this badge at the top (alongside existing badges): 
  `[![AI Generated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-100%25_AI_Generated-blueviolet)](CONTRIBUTING.md)`
- Embed `docs/orion.png` using HTML for right alignment in the first section (adjust width as needed, e.g., 150-200px):
  ```html
  <img src="docs/orion.png" align="right" width="180" alt="ORION Logo">
  ```
- **Action**: Ask the user for feedback on the visual layout after applying.

### 2. Contributing Policy (README & CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Policy**: "Source code changes must be generated by AI using a task prompt. Manual edits are allowed for other files like documentation and configuration."
- **Workflow**:
  1.  Create an Issue.
  2.  Create a task file: `.github/tasks/<ISSUE_NUMBER>_<snake_case_title>.md`.
  3.  Use the appropriate template from `.github/prompts/` (if applicable).
  4.  Execute the task with an AI agent.
  5.  Follow the "Task Retrospective Process" defined in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### 3. GitHub Templates
- Create directory `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` if it doesn't exist.
- Create `bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md` with standard fields (Description, Reproduction, Expected Behavior).
- Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- **Crucial**: The PR template must include:
  - `[ ] I certify that the source code in this PR was generated by AI.`
  - `[ ] Link to task file: .github/tasks/NUMBER_title.md`

### 4. Consistency Review
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Ensure they don't contradict the new AI policy.
- Scan ALL markdown files in the repo for inconsistencies or omissions regarding the new workflow.
- **Action**: List any inconsistencies found in the **Retrospective** section below.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] README has badge and logo.
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md details the AI-first workflow.
- [ ] Issue and PR templates exist.
- [ ] All markdown files reviewed and inconsistencies logged.

## Retrospective

### Task Execution Summary
**Completed:** All major objectives were achieved during the conversation session.
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot
**Execution Time:** ~30 minutes of conversation
**Status:** Completed with user feedback incorporated

### What Was Accomplished
1. ✅ **README.md Updates**: Added AI Generated badge, logo image (right-aligned), and updated contributing section
2. ✅ **CONTRIBUTING.md Updates**: Added comprehensive AI-first workflow section with task-based development process
3. ✅ **GitHub Templates**: Created Issue templates (bug_report.md, feature_request.md) and PR template with AI certification
4. ✅ **Copilot Instructions**: Updated to reflect new AI-first workflow and task templates

### User Feedback Incorporated
- **Layout approval**: User approved the README layout with badge and right-aligned logo
- **Policy refinement**: Clarified "Code-Focused" AI policy (source code must be AI-generated, docs/config can be manual)
- **Template preferences**: User requested specific AI certification checkboxes in PR template

### Inconsistencies Found & Resolved
1. **Task Template Reference**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` had outdated template references - **FIXED**
2. **Contributing Workflow**: Previous CONTRIBUTING.md didn't mention task-based development - **ADDED**
3. **Missing Templates**: Repository lacked Issue/PR templates standard for open source - **CREATED**

### Files Modified (Git Status)
- `M .github/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated with new task workflow
- `M CONTRIBUTING.md` - Added AI-first development workflow  
- `M README.md` - Added AI badge, logo, and contributing updates
- `?? .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Created bug/feature templates
- `?? .github/pull_request_template.md` - Created PR template with AI certification
- `?? .github/tasks/publish_repo.md` - This task file

### Blockers Encountered
- **None** - All requirements were successfully implemented

### Recommendations for Future Tasks
1. **Commit Strategy**: Recommend committing these changes as "feat: prepare repository for publication with AI-first workflow"
2. **Documentation**: The new workflow is now fully documented and ready for public contributors
3. **Process Validation**: Consider testing the new workflow with a sample issue/task to validate the process
