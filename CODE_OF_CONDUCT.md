This project adopts the **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct** (v2.1). We are committed to providing
a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors and users.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities & Scope

This Code applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially
representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

**https://github.com/omnixs/orion/issues** with the label `code-of-conduct`.

All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly. Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
security of the reporter of any incident.
