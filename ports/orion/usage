orion provides CMake targets:

  find_package(orion CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE orion::orion_lib)

The library requires nlohmann-json and rapidxml, which are automatically
linked as transitive dependencies.

Optional: Enable spdlog support by installing with the [spdlog] feature:
  vcpkg install orion[spdlog]

Example usage in your project:
  #include <orion/api/engine.hpp>
  #include <orion/api/logger.hpp>
  
  auto engine = orion::api::BusinessRulesEngine::create();
  auto result = engine->evaluate_decision(dmn_xml, decision_id, context);
